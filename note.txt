- Repo works right away on pytorch 0.4.1, pip requirement is at requirements_0.4.txt
- Training on COCO 2014

# 07-07-2019
- Training takes 6 hours for 1 epoch.
- mAP ~ 45% after 10 epochs, resnet50 backbone. 
- Validation is very slow as well compared to darknet => should evaluate every 4 epochs instead

- Train Person dataset

- Made repo works with pytorch 1.1.0 (1.2.0 has issue with ~ and 1 - bool)
